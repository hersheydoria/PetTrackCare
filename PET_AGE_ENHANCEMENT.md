# Pet Age Enhancement - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Enhanced the pet age system to display age in months and days format instead of just years, providing more accurate and detailed age information for pets.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Owner Screen (`lib/screens/profile_owner_screen.dart`)

#### Added Features:
- **Date of Birth Field**: Replaced the simple age input with a date picker for date of birth
- **Age Calculation**: Added helper methods to calculate age from birth date in years, months, and days
- **Enhanced Display**: Age now shows detailed format like "1 year, 3 months old" or "2 months, 15 days old"

#### Key Methods Added:
- `_calculateAge(DateTime birthDate)`: Calculates exact age components
- `_formatAge(DateTime birthDate)`: Formats age for display in pet form
- `_getFormattedAge(Map<String, dynamic> pet)`: Formats age for pet list display
- `_formatAgeFromBirthDate(DateTime birthDate)`: Formats age from birth date

#### Database Changes:
- Added `date_of_birth` field to pet records (maintains backward compatibility with existing `age` field)
- Both insert and update operations now save the date of birth

### 2. Pets Screen (`lib/screens/pets_screen.dart`)

#### Enhancements:
- Updated pet age display to use the new detailed format
- Added the same helper methods for age calculation and formatting
- Maintains consistency with the profile screen display

### 3. Profile Sitter Screen (`lib/screens/profile_sitter_screen.dart`)

#### Updates:
- Enhanced age display for assigned pets
- Added helper methods for consistent age formatting across the app

## Age Display Examples

| Pet Age | Old Display | New Display |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Born today | "0 years old" | "0 days old" |
| 15 days old | "0 years old" | "15 days old" |
| 2 months old | "0 years old" | "2 months old" |
| 2 months, 15 days | "0 years old" | "2 months, 15 days old" |
| 6 months old | "0 years old" | "6 months old" |
| 1 year, 3 months | "1 year old" | "1 year, 3 months old" |
| 2 years exactly | "2 years old" | "2 years old" |

## Technical Details

### Age Calculation Logic:
1. Calculate years, months, and days between birth date and current date
2. Handle edge cases for month/day overflow
3. Format display based on the largest non-zero unit

### Backward Compatibility:
- Existing pets with only `age` field will have their approximate birth date calculated
- New pets will store precise birth dates
- Fallback to old format if date parsing fails

### User Experience:
- Interactive date picker with calendar interface
- Real-time age display updates when date is selected
- Consistent formatting across all screens

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate**: Precise age tracking especially important for young animals
2. **Better Care**: Enables more accurate health and behavior monitoring
3. **Professional**: Provides veterinary-level age precision
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive date picker interface
5. **Flexible**: Adapts display format based on pet's age (days, months, years)
