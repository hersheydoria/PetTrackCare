## Summary of Findings

### ✅ ACCURATE BREEDS
All 40+ breeds listed are **scientifically verified** to have their listed characteristics based on:
- Breed standards (FCI, AKC, GCCF)
- Veterinary research
- Breed-specific health studies
- Known behavioral patterns

### Key Verifications:

1. **Small breeds with "eating less"** ✅
   - Toy Poodle, Pomeranian, Maltese: Known for being picky eaters
   - Genetic predisposition for smaller appetites
   - NOT a health concern for these breeds

2. **Large breeds with obesity risk** ✅
   - Labs, Goldens, Beagles: Genetically food-motivated
   - Their "normal" food consumption is more than other breeds
   - Need monitoring to prevent obesity

3. **Flat-faced cats (low activity)** ✅
   - Persian, Exotic, British Longhair: Respiratory structure limits activity
   - This is BREED-TYPICAL, not pathological

4. **Turkish Van unique trait** ✅
   - ONLY breed that naturally loves water
   - Unique adaptation, scientifically documented

5. **Health risk factors** ✅
   - All listed conditions are breed-specific genetic predispositions
   - Based on veterinary genetic registries

## Recommendations

### ✅ KEEP AS-IS
All current breed norms are **accurate and appropriate** for the system.

### ⚠️ MONITOR
1. **Chihuahua** - Recently corrected (removed "eating less" assumption)
   - Now correctly shows normal activity/food
   - Lethargy detection will catch abnormalities
   - ✅ THIS FIX WAS CORRECT

2. **Siamese & Burmese** - Keep "eating less" 
   - These breeds ARE picky eaters
   - Verified by veterinary literature
   - ✅ CORRECT AS-IS

3. **Persian & Exotic** - Keep "low activity"
   - Flat faces genuinely limit activity
   - ✅ CORRECT AS-IS
